# Anchor Tutorial Code
| [Anchor Tutorials](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/introduction.html)

I will be using Solana's devnet to run the tutorials as I cannot get `solana-test-validator` running on my local machine or VM or WSL. Bleh. Add keypairs used in the tutorials will be added here as part of the journey.

Aiming to do most of the coding on my windows box and will use the keys I initially created in `repos\rust\solana\devFileWallet\validator-keypair.json`

Windows: `pubkey: 3x96ZZRiJk5GSiMrVLAKpkdESvAyTv1RiWfhdiBL3sjy`
WSL: `pubkey: ELkAFvD12UjUntEWZnocaKfkojHPbcEU8Ncv22Ajcau9` (in case Windows is being a bitch and a half)

Ideally, this is supposed to be run on the local machine but since test validator is not working on Windows or WSL or VM I am stuck using devnet. I will not deploy this version to devnet as I work through the examples as I need the right account associated with the program first.
